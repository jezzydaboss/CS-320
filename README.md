How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?




To ensure my code is both functional and secure, start with disciplined unit testing using tools like JUnitâ€”validating edge cases, expected outcomes, and failure modes. Pair this with static code analysis and dependency scanning to catch vulnerabilities early. Secure coding practices, such as input validation, proper authentication flows, and least privilege access, should be baked into your architecture from the start. Functional reliability comes from test coverage and modular design; security comes from anticipating misuse and enforcing boundaries. Interpreting user needs begins with active listening and contextual analysis. Whether you're working from client interviews, tax law scenarios, or business requirements, distill the core goals and constraints into actionable features. Translate those into user stories or use cases that guide your implementation. When designing software, think in layers: start with the problem domain, define clear interfaces, and build services that are testable, maintainable, and aligned with user expectations. Your design should reflect empathy for both the end user and the developer who inherits your code.
